    # Combining Tables with `JOIN`

    In this notebook we put tables back together to answer questions that no single table can answer. We start with the towns and their counties, then move to the Northwind orders, their lines, their products and their categories. Along the way we count the rows before and after each join, and we find the rows a join leaves out. After class, you will ask the same kind of question of a database on a server.

    # 2. What a Join Leaves Out

    `JOIN` keeps only the rows that have a match in the other table. If a county has no matching town, that county is not in the result, and there is no error message or warning.

    To find those counties, we can use `LEFT JOIN`, which keeps every row of the table on the left, here `counties`. If a county has no matching town, the columns from `towns` contain `NULL` in that row, and `WHERE t.name IS NULL` keeps exactly those rows. The following query finds the counties with no town whose average bill is over $15,000.

    The bill condition is in `ON`, which decides what counts as a match. If we move it to `WHERE`, the query runs without an error, but the result is empty. `WHERE` keeps rows after the join, and for a county with no such town the bill is `NULL`, which is not over $15,000.

    A query like this one, which finds the rows in one table that have no match in another, is called an **anti join**. When you write a `JOIN`, it is a good idea to check which rows it left out, and an anti join is one way to do that.

    `RIGHT JOIN` keeps every row of the table on the right, and `FULL JOIN` keeps every row of both tables. For `towns` and `counties`, `JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN` and `FULL JOIN` all return the same 351 rows, because every town names a county in `counties` and every county has towns. With a few shows from the TV show database, each join returns a different number of rows.

    # 5. After Class: The Same Joins on a Server

    So far every database we have used is a file on your computer. Most companies keep theirs on a server, and you connect to it over the network. Babson runs one with **AdventureWorks**, a bicycle company's sales database, on Microsoft SQL Server. The version of SQL that SQL Server uses is called **T-SQL**. It differs from DuckDB's in small ways: tables are inside schemas, as in `Sales.SalesOrderHeader`, and you write `TOP 5` after `SELECT` where DuckDB writes `LIMIT 5` at the end.

    **Set it up once:**

    1. In a Terminal in the root folder of your repository, run `uv add "pymssql==2.4.5" python-dotenv`. Keep the version number: this one also installs on Apple Silicon Macs with macOS 14, where the newest does not. If the install fails on an older Mac, email me.
    2. Open `.gitignore` in the root folder and check that it lists `.env`. If it does not, add the line `.env` and commit that first. Your repository is public, and a password committed once stays in its history. The cell below does not connect until `.gitignore` lists `.env`.
    3. Make a file named exactly `.env` in the root folder, in VS Code. Copy into it the four lines on the **Connecting to SQL Server** page, in the Class Information module on Canvas. If you change `.env` later, run your query cell again: marimo does not notice a change to a file on its own.
    4. Before every commit, look at the list of changed files in GitHub Desktop. If `.env` is in the list, it is not ignored: do not commit.

    The cell below reads the server, the login and the password from `.env`, so they never appear in the notebook. It defines `ask_server`, which works like `ask` but takes only the query.
